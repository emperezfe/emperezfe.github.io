    <!-- About the role -->
    <article class="card">
      <h3>About the role</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        Game designer for two and a half years. Responsible for the game design, since the concept phase until the end of development, of
        <strong>14 educational game templates</strong>. The games are published inside the Lingokids app and include puzzles, story-driven games,
        arcade games, logic games and creativity games, for ages 2–8. For every game I worked on, my responsibility was to design systems
        and mechanics, levels, and UIs, and work in a small team with an artist and a programmer to develop the game from beginning to end.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-5">
        I created concepts from scratch, pitched ideas and sketches, then produced high-level concept documents and GDDs along with
        <strong>Unity prototypes</strong>. During development my role was to supervise the design and make sure the game’s philosophy was properly
        understood and implemented, assisting all departments when needed, and <strong>balancing/tweaking</strong> systems to be appropriate for
        our players. After publishing, I took part in <strong>data analysis</strong> and polishing actions. Throughout development, I also prepared,
        attended and analyzed <strong>in-person user tests with kids</strong>.

      <h3>Selected examples</h3>

      <!-- 1: Bouncing Billy -->
      <div class="two-col" style="margin-bottom:22px">
        <div>
          <strong>Bouncing Billy</strong> is an arcade game in which the player moves a spaceship in a map full of obstacles looking for
          letters that form a word. Level design was key: spaces needed to be wide and backtracking had to be smooth and readable.
        </div>
        <figure class="project-media" style="margin:0">
          <img src="img/bouncingbilly.jpeg" alt="Bouncing Billy — arcade letter hunt" />
          <figcaption class="muted" style="padding:6px 2px 0">Bouncing Billy — arcade letter hunt; wide, backtrack-friendly navigation.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <!-- 2: Photo Album: Game  -->
      <div class="two-col-alt" style="margin-bottom:22px">
        <figure class="project-media" style="margin:0">

          <figcaption class="muted" style="padding:6px 2px 0">Photo Album — open exploration + timed taps to photograph animals.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div>
          Had the chance to rework the game <strong>Photo Album</strong>, which is a exploratory game about navigating an open map to find animals and take pictures of them. Some animals are hidden;
          others fly by briefly, leaving only seconds to tap and take the picture. An in-game album lets kids revisit their photos aloing with reading some animal facts. The game can be checked here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmni7cOOTOU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lingokids.com/photo-album-game</a>

      <!-- 3: Wagon Catch -->
      <div class="two-col" style="margin-bottom:22px">
        <div>
          <strong>Wagon Catch</strong> approaches counting: objects fall from the sky and the player must collect a target amount.
          Power-ups, boosters and punishing power-ups modify the loop and pacing.
        </div>
        <figure class="project-media" style="margin:0">

        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- 7: Artist Playground (separado) -->
      <div class="two-col" style="margin-bottom:22px">
        <div>
          <strong>Artist Playground</strong> is a creativity game, an open play tool in which several brushes, backgrounds and stamps are provided to the player. This game had no concrete objectives rather than letting the players experiment and create: just providing the tools to let the players set their own goals for their drawings.
